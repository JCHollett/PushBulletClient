# PushBulletClient
This is a DLL for pushbullet as a client and socket listener. Pushbullet is an API for communicating with multiple devices using an authentication token. The API used http verbs. Using C# these verbs were programmed into an API for personal learning.

The API allows you to send Notes to email addresses although, it seems like it's not working right now with their servers which I think is not my fault.
As well as sending SMS messages with a phone attached to the service, which still works.

Why is this useful? You can use this DLL to send yourself notifications by phone. For example, if you're running a C# application that is a service you can implement this DLL to send you notifications if something fails.
This is a pure Utility project that I intend to use with other projects that I Do for fun.
